# PWM_GENERATOR
The provided Verilog code efficiently generates a PWM signal with a controllable duty cycle using button inputs. Debouncing ensures stable button presses, and the overall design leverages a 100 MHz clock to produce a 10 MHz PWM output. This is a common approach in digital design for motor control, LED dimming, and other applications requiring PWM signals.
